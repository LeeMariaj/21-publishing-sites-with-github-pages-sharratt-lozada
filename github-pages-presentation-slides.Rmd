#What is GitHub Pages?
.pull-left[

### It's pretty straightforward...

- GitHub Pages is GitHub's webpages hosting service. With Github Pages, you can quickly and easily create public webpages from repos hosted and published through GitHub.
 
- All you need to do is upload your files to a repository, head into Settings to turn on GitHub Pages and its live and hosting your content. 
<br>

- GitHub Pages are public webpages hosted and published through GitHub. The quickest way to get up and running is by using the Jekyll Theme Chooser to load a pre-made theme. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style, but more about that later...

- **Free** - You can host your pages for free and there are no hidden costs.
- **Subdomain** - You get a subdomain (username.github.io) which is provided over HTTPS.<sup>1</sup>
- **Customisible Subdomain** - If you want a more professional and accessible domain, you can create your own domain by adding a CNAME file to the repo or by changing the project's settings.

- **Open-source** - Unless you change the settings to go private, your repo is open source, making it easier to showcase your code.
- **Real-time Updates** - When you commit an update, GitHub automatically pushes the update out live.
- **Design themes with Jekyll** -You can use a static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for your webpage, which means that you can use simple HTML/CSS themes.<sup>2</sup>

#One Word of Caution...

##**Warning!**

 - **GitHub Pages are static** and do not support server-side scripting such as, **PHP, Ruby, or Python**.

 - Redirecting URLs is awkward with GitHub Pages.This is important especially when you have an old website that you want to migrate to Hugo; some links may be broken, in which case you can easily redirect them with Netlify.

- One of the best features of Netlify that is not available with GitHub Pages is that Netlify can generate a unique website for preview when a GitHub pull request is submitted to your GitHub repository. This is extremely useful when someone else (or even yourself) proposes changes to your website, since you have a chance to see what the website would look like before you merge the pull request.

#What's Jekyll and how do you use it?

.pull-left[
- Jekyll is a static site generator written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner. It is distributed under the open source MIT license.

- Jekyll started a web development trend towards static websites. As of 2017 Jekyll was ranked the most popular static site generator, largely due to its adoption by GitHub. 

- Jekyll provides design templates for static webpages. These can be installed by integrating your GitHub Page with Jekyll.

#What's Jekyll and how do you use it? 

.pull-left[
- However, Jekyll is difficult to install as it requires Ruby programming language and that's outside of the scope of this presentation. 

- Essentially, Jekyll allows you to use design templates for your static Pages. This can save you a lot of time writing HTML and CSS, but for today we'll stick to the basic GitHub Pages setup.
