# Introduction to Data Science Workshop: GitHub Pages

# Quick intro to GitHub Pages

Markdown was originally made to be a substitute for HTML in forums. The original implementation doesn’t really cover formatting such as tables.
GitHub also uses their own flavor of Markdown (called GitHub markdown) as the main format for their webpages, which makes maintaining them much easier than having to edit raw HTML. They extended markdown so you can add tables and better code formatting.

A variation of GitHub markdown is Rmarkdown, which is Markdown + R. Rmarkdown is really useful for reproducible analyses, and it can also be used in conjunction with Shiny to make interactive slides.

# Since we already know HTML and CSS… we are using these two scripting languages for the Workshop

Don’t be alarmed! This repo has the entire structure already in place for you to start working.
The Workshop consists in you creating a blog of yourself in which you tell the users your favorite food, places, cities, your favorite spots in Berlin, family, friends, pets, and unique interests!

Note that there is a dropdown menu on top of the website (thanks to Bootstrap!) where you can make your blog as user-interactive as possible! So, make use of these handy buttons and dropdown menus.

Maybe you can take advantage of this unique website to share your professional goals and accomplishments by posting the URL in your LinkedIn account.

Few notes of advice:
1. Fork the repo! (top right-hand corner): This means that you’ll be creating a copy of it in your profile instead of committing and pushing changes to the original one. (Everyone will be creating their own blog).
2. HTML and CSS structure is already in place: take some time to understand the structure and how every file is connected to each other and navigate through the website.
3. Fork-Edit-Push-Refresh: You can see the changes you are making in the website once you push to your repo. Just go to your link and refresh!

# If you're still interested in using Jekyll...

Jekyll is what’s known as a static site generator. It will build a website from simple text files that are in Markdown. Markdown is much easier to work with, since you don’t have to worry about adding HTML tags and accidentally breaking it.

The other nice thing about Jekyll is that it will integrate things like Google Analytics, Tags, and search into your website structure.
Jekyll is built into GitHub, so we just need to edit the files in our repository to have GitHub automatically build the webpage.

There are some steps you need to take to work with Jekyll from your local computer:
1. Install Ruby in your computer
https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/
2. Install Jekyll in your computer
https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/
3. Clone your repo and open it in a code editor
4. Install and activate the Jekyll extension in the code editor
5. In the code editor terminal type: jekyll new .--force
6. This will create files required to launch your website in GitHub Pages
7. Follow through the official documentation of specific Jekyll themes: 
https://pages.github.com/themes/
