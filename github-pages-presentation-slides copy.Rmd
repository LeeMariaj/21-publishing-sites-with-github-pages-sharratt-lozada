#What is GitHub Pages?

### It's pretty straightforward...

- GitHub Pages is GitHub's webpages hosting service. With Pages, you can quickly and easily create public webpages from repos hosted and published through GitHub.
 
- All you need to do is upload your files to a repository, head into Settings to turn on GitHub Pages and its live and hosting your content. 
<br>

- The quickest way to get up and running is by using a pre-set theme provided by Jekyll. You can then modify your GitHub Pages' content and style, but more about that later...

- **Free** - You can host your pages for free and there are no hidden costs.

- **Secure Subdomain** - You get a subdomain (username.github.io) which is provided over HTTPS.<sup>1</sup>

- **Customisible Subdomain** - If you want a more professional and accessible domain, you can create your own domain by adding a CNAME file to the repo or by changing the project's settings.

- **Showcase Your Code** - COME BACK TO THIS - ADD EXAMPLES  - YOU

- **Open-source** - Unless you change the settings to go private, your repo is open source, making it easier to showcase your code.

- **Real-time Updates** - When you commit an update, GitHub automatically pushes the update out live.

- **Design themes** - You can use HTML and CSS to change the content and design of your page. Alternatively, you can use a static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) for pre-set HTML/CSS themes.<sup>2</sup>

#Prerequisites...

What you need to have before setting up GitHub Pages:

  - **Git** 

  - **GitHub Account**

  - **GitHub Dekstop**

  - **Code** - Ideally, some code you want to showcase using a static webpage.

Before we get started, let’s clarify some common terms::
- **HTML** - The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser.

- **CSS** - Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML.

- **Design themes** - You can use HTML and CSS to change the content and design of your page. Alternatively, you can use a static site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com)

#One Word of Caution...

##**Warning!**

 - **GitHub Pages are static** - Pages does not support server-side scripting such as, **PHP, Ruby, or Python**. 
 
 - **Beyond the basics, making good-looking Pages can be tricky** - You’ll need to know the basics of Git and Jekyll. Jekyll is the middleware, written in Ruby, that takes all your files and transforms them into a pretty website using the Liquid templating language. Finally, you’ll use Markdown markup syntax for formatting content like your blog posts.
 
- There are two ways to design your webpages:
  1. Using **Jekyll** 
  2. Using **HTML & CSS**
  
- The workshop will cover how to use **HTML & CSS** files with GitHub Pages.

**Step 5 - Clone Your Repo to Add `HTML` & `CSS` files**
- For more advanced changes, it's best to clone your repo and make changes locally.

- **Important:** GitHub Pages will automatically incorporate your HTML and CSS files into your webpage.

- Any changes made in the files in your repo will be automatically updated after you commit.

#What's Jekyll and how do you use it?

.pull-left[
- [**Jekyll**](https://jekyllrb.com) is a static site generator written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner. It is distributed under the open source MIT license.

- Jekyll started a web development trend towards static websites. As of 2017 Jekyll was ranked the most popular static site generator, largely due to its adoption by GitHub. 

- Jekyll provides design templates for static webpages. These can be installed by integrating your GitHub Page with Jekyll.

#What's Jekyll and how do you use it? 

.pull-left[
- However, Jekyll is difficult to install as it requires Ruby programming language and that's outside of the scope of this presentation. 

- Essentially, Jekyll allows you to use design templates for your static Pages. This can save you a lot of time writing HTML and CSS, but for today we'll stick to the basic GitHub Pages setup.
